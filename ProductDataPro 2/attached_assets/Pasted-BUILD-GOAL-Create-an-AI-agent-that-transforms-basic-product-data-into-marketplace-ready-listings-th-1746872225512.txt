BUILD GOAL: Create an AI agent that transforms basic product data into marketplace-ready listings through intelligent analysis and enhancement.

PRODUCT CONCEPT:
This is NOT a simple "CSV enhancement tool" - it's an AI product assistant that acts as an expert e-commerce team member. The agent should:

1. ANALYZE products intelligently to understand what they actually are
2. IDENTIFY marketplace optimization opportunities autonomously
3. GENERATE professional-quality product content that reads like it was created by human experts
4. OPTIMIZE listings specifically for each marketplace's unique algorithms and requirements

KEY CAPABILITIES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. INTELLIGENT PRODUCT UNDERSTANDING
   - The agent should recognize products from minimal data
   - It should understand product categories, features, and selling points
   - The analysis should go beyond basic classification to truly understand the product

2. AUTONOMOUS LISTING OPTIMIZATION
   - The agent should identify what's missing without explicit instructions
   - It should prioritize what enhancements will have the biggest impact
   - The analysis should explain WHY changes are recommended

3. HUMAN-QUALITY CONTENT CREATION
   - All generated content must sound natural and professional
   - Different marketplaces need different writing styles (Amazon vs. Etsy)
   - Content should be genuinely persuasive and converting

4. MARKETPLACE INTELLIGENCE
   - The agent should know each marketplace's unique requirements
   - It should apply marketplace-specific optimization strategies
   - Formatting and structuring should match each platform's best practices

USER EXPERIENCE:
The user should feel like they're working with a knowledgeable e-commerce assistant, not just uploading a file to a tool. The agent should:

- Explain its analysis and recommendations in conversational language
- Show reasoning about why certain optimizations are suggested
- Present before/after comparisons with explanations of improvements
- Guide the user through the process like a consultant would

IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS:
- Create sophisticated prompts that elicit expert-level responses from the AI
- Build a conversation flow that feels like interacting with an assistant
- Focus on quality of output rather than just completing fields
- Ensure the agent can explain its reasoning and recommendations

This should be positioned as an AI teammate that brings expertise to the user's business, not just a utility that fills in missing data.
